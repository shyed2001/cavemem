Fix the Claude Code hook integration end-to-end and harden the npm publish path. With these changes the memory system actually works after `npm install -g cavemem` — verified by the new `scripts/e2e-publish.sh` test that packs the artifact, installs it into an isolated prefix, and drives every hook event with realistic Claude Code payloads.

**Hook protocol**

- Handlers now read the field names Claude Code actually sends — `tool_name`, `tool_response`, `last_assistant_message`, `source`, `reason` — while keeping the legacy aliases (`tool`, `tool_output`, `turn_summary`) for non-Claude IDEs and existing tests.
- The CLI no longer dumps internal telemetry JSON onto stdout. That JSON was being injected verbatim into the agent's context as `additionalContext` for `SessionStart` / `UserPromptSubmit`. Telemetry now goes to stderr; stdout carries Claude Code's `{ "hookSpecificOutput": { "hookEventName": "...", "additionalContext": "..." } }` shape only when there is real context to surface.
- `Storage.createSession` is now `INSERT OR IGNORE`, and `SessionStart` skips the prior-session preface for non-startup sources, so resume / clear / compact no longer crash with PK conflicts.
- The Claude Code installer writes `cavemem hook run <name> --ide claude-code`, and the CLI's `hook run` accepts `--ide` so handlers know who invoked them (Claude Code itself never sends an `ide` field).

**Publishable artifact**

- `cavemem` no longer lists the private `@cavemem/mcp-server` and `@cavemem/worker` packages as runtime dependencies. Tsup already bundles every `@cavemem/*` module via `noExternal`, so the workspace deps moved to `devDependencies` and `npm install cavemem` resolves cleanly.
- The bin entrypoint guard (`isMainEntry()`) now compares realpaths via `pathToFileURL(realpathSync(...))`, so the binary works when invoked through npm's symlinked `bin/` shim — previously `--version` and every other command silently exited 0 with no output.
- Tsup's `banner` option was producing two `#!/usr/bin/env node` lines in every dynamic-import chunk (one from the source file, one from the banner), which broke `cavemem mcp` with `SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token`. The banner is gone; the shebang lives in the source files that need it.
- A new `prepublishOnly` script (`apps/cli/scripts/prepack.mjs`) stages `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `hooks-scripts/` into `apps/cli/` so `changeset publish` produces a complete tarball. The script no-ops outside the source repo so installing the tarball never re-runs it.
- The root workspace package was renamed from `cavemem` to `cavemem-monorepo` (still `private:true`) to remove a name collision that caused `pnpm --filter cavemem` to match the root instead of the publishable cli package.

**CI**

- The release workflow now runs all four gates (`pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`) and the new `bash scripts/e2e-publish.sh` end-to-end check before `changeset publish` is allowed to publish.
